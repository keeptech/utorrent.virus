The default uTorrent settings might be acceptable for the average user. But these settings won’t usually meet higher expectations of serious users.

Yes, uTorrent is already out-of-the-box optimized to speed up downloads. But not everybody has the same network, ISP, bandwidth, or computer. Configuring uTorrent to increase download speed is relative to one’s resources.

## What’s New in uTorrent? 

uTorrent (or µTorrent) has diversified from the traditional long-time favorite uTorrent Classic. Now (from a couple of years already), uTorrent brought other versions of their torrent client, including uTorrent Web and uTorrent Android. Now, you can also manage uTorrent Classic remotely. Add, remove or monitor your uTorrent Classic torrents remotely from a web browser and from any device.

#### The latest features (as of Nov 2021) for the best uTorrent settings are: 

* Bandwidth Optimization and Scheduling Capabilities.
* Drive faster download speeds and earn BTT tokens. 
* Drag and Drop multiple torrent files and hand-pick their sub-files.

## How Does utorrent Work?

 *Peer-to-peer (P2P) -** Think of P2P as a platform where two or more people can share files directly, without using a middleman or third parties. In the same manner, P2P sharing is the distribution of data using this technology.
 *Torrent -** Torrent is a file format that contains all the information you want to upload or download. It dates back to 2011. Before, people downloaded their files from a single source. Now, torrents have changed file sharing by decentralizing the process. That means you can spread one file among thousands of devices, each holding a piece of data from a much larger file.
 *Torrenting -** Torrenting is a variant of P2P sharing. Usually, when you download a file from the internet, that file is stored on a central server somewhere. Torrenting, however, is decentralized, meaning your file (torrent) is available for every device on the network to download and use, and files from other users are available to you.
 *BitTorrent -** BitTorrent is a P2P communication protocol that allows you to upload or download files.
 *utorrent -** utorrent is a BitTorrent client company. They work on the same principle, only uTorrent is more lightweight software, making it one of the most popular BitTorrent clients.
